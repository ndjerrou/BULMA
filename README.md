Trying to use the new CSS-Framework [BULMA](https://bulma.io/)

I used components such as :

- Cards

- Medias

- Navbar

To display a nice little page, actually two with the login page (you have to click on the Sign In Button on the top right)

I encourage you to take a look at this nice and handly framework to be more productive with your css

Last but not least, we really appreciate the responsivness of the framework regardless the components or elements you use
